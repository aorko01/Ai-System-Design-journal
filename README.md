# 🚀 AI Engineering & Infrastructure Journey

Welcome to my public journey into **AI Engineering** and **AI Infrastructure** — where I document everything I'm learning, building, and breaking down along the way.

---

## 📚 What to Expect

This repository contains:

- 🔎 **Weekly logs** of my learning
- 🧠 **Projects** built alongside new concepts
- 🛠️ **Engineering insights** from working with AI systems
- 📖 **Blogs and notes** for key topics I encounter
- 🧩 **Math & Theory support** with external resources and personal takeaways

---

## 📌 Prerequisites (for anyone following along)

You don't need to be a math genius or a deep learning pro. This repo is created with accessibility in mind. You'll be comfortable here if you know:

- 🧮 Basic matrix operations (multiplication, transpose, etc.)
- 📈 High-school level calculus, statistics, and probability
- 💻 Some familiarity with Python

> If I encounter any mathematical or theoretical barrier, I'll document how I overcame it — including:
> - Resources I used
> - What worked and what didn't
> - Time-efficient learning tips

## 🏗️ How I'm Structuring This

### 🗓️ Week-by-Week Learning Logs
Each week I'll share what I've learned, links to external readings, personal notes, and reflection.

### 💡 Projects
I believe in **learning by building** — so I'll be pairing most major topics with a relevant project. Expect:
- Core algorithm implementations
- Scalable MLOps pipelines
- Cloud deployments
- Infrastructure insights

### ✍️ Blogs & Explanations
I'll write short blogs when I feel a topic deserves a deeper dive — especially when it's something I initially struggled with.

## 🌱 Why I'm Doing This

This is both:
- A **learning-in-public** log for myself
- A **guide for others** who want to become practical, project-focused AI engineers and infra contributors

If you're on the same path — I hope this helps, saves you time, and maybe even inspires your next project!
